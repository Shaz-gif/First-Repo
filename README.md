### Scientific Calculator Implementation
This project entails building a versatile calculator application using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a detailed breakdown:

## 1. Simple Calculator
Functionality: Handles straightforward arithmetic expressions comprising one operator and two operands.
Supported Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
Input Validation: Ensures that the input expression is correctly formatted with the specified operator and operands.
Evaluation: Computes the result of the expression without relying on built-in evaluation functions like eval().
User Interface: Provides a clean and intuitive interface for inputting expressions and displaying results.
## 2. Stack Implementation
Purpose: Introduces a Stack data structure to manage the computation required for evaluating more complex expressions.
Core Methods: Includes essential stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and checking for empty stacks.
Usage: Utilized within the advanced calculator to handle expressions involving parentheses.
## 3. Advanced Calculator
Enhanced Functionality: Extends the capabilities of the calculator to support expressions with multiple operators and nested parentheses.
Tokenization: Parses input expressions into a list of tokens, removing unnecessary whitespaces and converting operands to integers.
Parenthesis Matching: Implements a mechanism to verify that all parentheses in the expression are properly matched and nested.
Evaluation with Stacks: Utilizes the Stack data structure to evaluate expressions efficiently and accurately, taking into account operator precedence and parentheses.
Error Handling: Handles potential errors such as division by zero, providing informative messages to the user.
User Interface Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the GUI to provide a cohesive user experience.
## Overall
This project combines elements of software design, algorithmic problem-solving, and GUI development to create a robust and user-friendly calculator application. By implementing both simple and advanced calculator functionalities, it caters to a wide range of user needs, from basic arithmetic calculations to more complex mathematical expressions. Additionally, by avoiding the use of built-in evaluation functions, the project promotes understanding of fundamental concepts and enhances security by preventing potential exploits.
